* FIXED: entity_file() to avoid a crash if the entity is not in the catalog.

* ADDED: Parse not-quoted attribute values that require quotes by parsing
  upto the next layout character.  Give a warning.  For example:
  <hr width=50%> is parsed as <hr width="50%">, but a warning is displayed.

* FIXED: Crash if start of file is not a declaration but ordinary non-blank
  text.

* ADDED: Improved source-location handling and some additional call-backs
  to the call-back interface, preparing the parser for supporting SGML
  syntax highlighting and checking editors.  See get_sgml_parser/2 and
  sgml_parse/2 predicates.

VERSION 1.0.7
=============

* IMPROVED: Redirect all memory management to print a fatal error message
  instead of crashing.

* IMPROVED: Handle the (illegal) comment <!-- some text -- more text -->
  more elegantly: assume <!-- will be terminated by --> and generate a
  warning if text was found outside --comment--.

* FIXED: Some issues in marked-section handling

* ADDED: Direct error reporting of sgml application through callback for
  demo purposes.  Message now includes the current dialect.

* FIXED: sgml application: do not convert case in XML mode.

* FIXED: Do not report error on not-declared xmlns attribute in XML mode.

* Cleaned Makefiles

VERSION 1.0.6
=============

* ADDED: SGML based documentation of the package with converters to LaTeX
  and HTML in Prolog.

* ADDED/MODIFIED: number(NumberMode) option to the load_structure/3.
  By default NUMBER and NUMBERS tokens are now parsed as tokens of digits.
  Using number(integer) they are converted to Prolog integers, provided
  they fit (Richard O'Keefe).

* ADDED: If a document is parsed without DTD and a catalog is provided,
  try finding a matching DTD file from the catalog.  If successful
  print a warning and load this DTD.

* FIXED: Ensure the -xml flag to the sgml utility works again.

* INSTALL: Check for existence of runtex

* INSTALL: Do not cache Prolog related variables.

* FIXED: signed/unsigned character handling in catalog.c (Richard O'Keefe)

* MODIFIED: Representation for source-locations.


VERSION 1.0.5
=============

* MODIFIED: Get SYSTEM entities relative to the file in which the
  entity is declared.  Get PUBLIC entities from the second argument
  if the catalog (entry) is not found.

* FIXED: Deal with elements only containing shortref references

* MODIFIED: Only insert missing close-tags that should not be on closing
  outer environments, not because an element is encountered that fits in
  an outer environment.  Improves error behaviour.

* ADDED: Print default list values in dtd2pl

* ADDED: Support for the content-model ANY.

* ADDED: option -xml to pl2dtd to force it loading a DTD in XML mode.

* FIXED: Do not expand SHORTREF inside CDATA marked sections and elements.

* ADDED: Properly deal with NUTOKEN: handling DTD default and validate type.

* FIXED: Expand parameter entities in SHORTREF declaraction (Richard O'Keefe).

* FIXED: Handling of < as last character of a CDATA element

* FIXED: proper handling of &#RE; in SHORTREF

* FIXED: Open CDATA element when encountering a CDATA entity.

* FIXED: SHORTTAG with attributes: <foo a=b/value/


VERSION 1.0.4
=============

* FIXED: file_to_dtd() not to free the created DTD.  This makes dtd2pl work
  again. (Richard O'Keefe)

* FIXED: Allow for layout before sub-models: ( (a,b)|c).  (Andrew Dadakov)

* FIXED: Allow for quoted nmtoken, etc. in ATTLIST declaration.
  (Andrew Dadakov)


VERSION 1.0.3
=============

* FIXED: Allow for (a,b), etc. instead of just (a|b) where an element-list
  is expected.


VERSION 1.0.2
=============

* ADDED: Partial SHORTTAG support (<tag/content/ and </>)

* ADDED: Prolog interface: map multi-valued attributes to a list.

* FIXED: ESIS output of the sgml utility to provide better compliant output
  for attributes (before the open-tag, including the type and in UPPERCASE).

* ADDED: Handling <!SHORTREF ...> and friends.

* FIXED: Added &#RS;, &#RE;, &#TAB; and &#SPACE; (Richard O'Keefe)

* FIXED: Processing instruction is now <?....[?]> (i.e. optional closing ?)
  Q: Is this XML or SGML?  Check docs!

* FIXED: Line-number info for DOCTYPE declarations holding [declaractions].

* FIXED: NUMBER attribute declaration with default (skip layout afterwards)

* ADDED: Support for NOTATION attribute

* FIXED: memory allocation/free bug in model-reduction ((a|b)*)

* ADDED: Passing processing instructions to the user

* FIXED: Independent case-sensitivity switch for entities (SGML entities are
  case sensitive).

* ADDED: SGML Blank-space handling

* FIXED: Completeness test for A&B?

* ADDED: Dummy make check (Richard O'Keefe)


VERSION 1.0.1
=============

* ADDED: Programmable XML namespace canonisation.

* ADDED: White space handling using the xlm:space attribute as well as
  allow for setting the initial default as option to load_structure.

* FIXED: Allow for <!ENTITY name 'value'> (i.e. without CDATA type decl).

* FIXED: Allow for <!DOCTYPE name [DTD]> (i.e. no public nor system)

* FIXED: Avoid crash on bad attribute-list

* ADDED: Reporting errors and warnings through print_message/2.

* FIXED: Handling of end-of-file in CDATA
