		  Documentation for the SGML2PL package

This directory contains the documentation for   the  sgml2pl package for
SWI-Prolog. The home of this package is

	http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/SWI-Prolog/packages/sgml2pl/

To build this documentation you  need   SWI-Prolog  installed as `pl' in
your path with the sgml package installed. In addition you need pdflatex
or latex.  Make targets:

	make [doc.pdf]		Make doc.pdf (requires pdflatex)
	make doc.ps		Make doc.ps (requires latex and dvips)
	make doc.html		Make HTML version of the documentation
	make clean		Remove generated file except for targets
	make distclean		Remove all generated files

doc2tex.pl, doc2html.pl and xml_convert.pl contain the sourcecode of the
converter. Especially xml_convert.pl,  defining   xml_select/3  might be
worth considering.

If you have a recent version of XPCE, you can also type

	pl -f browse.pl
	?- x.

To see the documentation  rendered   through  XPCE's  document rendering
system.
