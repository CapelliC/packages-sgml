TODO LIST:

	* Handling of external entities (both param and normal) in Prolog
	* Check ID/IDREF
	* Donot use quoted values for tag identifications.  Right now the
	  following leads to bad error handling:

		<tag name="value>
	* Allow for (a,b) as attribute-type (name-group)
	* Handle source-info in included SYSTEM entities
